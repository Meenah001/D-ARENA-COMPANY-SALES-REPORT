The data was loaded to power query, It was then transposed. This was done for easy access to promote the column headers

The first rows from the previous image were used as column headers, but not all the headers are correct. Therefore, further cleaning is needed

In order to get the correct column headers, the 'segment' and 'ship mode' column was selected and the rest of the column were "Unpivoted". This gave us the last two column shown in the above image i.e (the Attribute and Value) column

![Renamed column](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97677904/209468515-a155426f-87dd-4f8d-a516-7f26c1a28f0c.png)

The last two column shown in the previous image were renamed to "Order ID" and " Total Sales" respectively

# Findings and Recommendation

. In order to increase the sales in the other mode of shipment,most especially the 'Same day' ship mode. The quality should be increased, this will attract people of high taste too

---

. To increase the sales in US, sales promotion should be made through advertisement. This would increase people's awareness

---

. Home office product which recorded the lowest sales might be due to the below reasons;

1) It's pricey
2) It is not of high quality

The above reasons could be solved if the price is been reduced, also if the quality increased
